HNM-Ring Package
===============================
A generator initial conditions tool to handle Minor-Mercury and HNBody packages.
---------------------------------

``HNM-Ring package`` generates the initial conditions of input files for Minor-Mercury [(A. Amarante et al., 2020)](https://github.com/a-amarante/minor-mercury) and HNBody [(Rauch and Hamilton, 2002)](http://janus.astro.umd.edu/HNBody) packages. The user can manipulate several sets of initial condition configurations using ``input.ic`` file. It can handle single star systems, binary, triple, planetary, satellite, coorbital, asteroidal, among others.

For example, the user can handle with several initial disk density profiles for embryos and planetesimals (Raymond et al., 2004; Kokubo and Ida, 2000; Chambers et al., 1996) of the planetary formation integrations (see, e.g., Barbosa et al. (2020)).

The ``Solar Radiation Pressure`` (Burns et al., 1979; Mignard, 1984) can also take into account over numerical integrations.

The J2-J4-J6 ``Geometric Elements`` computational corrections (Renner and Sicardy, 2006; Borderies-Rappaport and Longaretti, 1994) were also implemented in this version.

How to compile and run
----------------------

The HNM-Ring package is written in ``C programming language``. In the current directory, you should have all files needed to compile and execute the program. Don't hesitate to contact me if any problem arises when trying to use it.
Current package is preconfigured for Linux and Mac OS X users with compile and clean tasks. Use your favorite C compiler, such as ``gcc``, to create an executable. For instance, on Linux or Mac, try:

   ``gcc hnm-ring.c -o hnm-ring -lm``

Now, it should be compiled.  Copy or link the executable wherever you want (wherever your input files are) to run your code using:

   ``./hnm-ring input.ic files.in mer`` (for Minor-Mercury simulations)

   ``./hnm-ring input.ic input.hnb hnbody`` (for HNBody simulations)

Or use the executable file ``hnm-ring`` instead for Linux and Mac OS X compilers:

   First type ``chmod +x hnm-ring`` and after that run your code using one of the commands above.
